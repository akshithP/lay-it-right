## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES

### Issue #1: Excessive Button Height on Mobile
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Component:** CTA Button (`.cta-mega`)
- **Affected Viewports:** Mobile (375px)
- **Description:** The "START PROJECT NOW" button has a height of 172px on mobile (26% of viewport), due to fixed padding (32px vertical) and large 24px font size that don't scale down.
- **Expected Behavior:** Button should be responsive with mobile-friendly height (44-56px)
- **Actual Behavior:** Button consumes 26% of mobile viewport, forces unnecessary scrolling
- **Evidence:** `button-mobile-375.png` shows button taking up excessive space
- **Impact:** Creates unusable mobile experience, poor touch target optimization
- **Browser:** All mobile browsers

## ðŸŸ  HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### Issue #2: Missing H1 Heading
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Component:** Hero Section
- **Affected Viewports:** Mobile/Tablet/Desktop
- **Description:** Main heading "LAY-IT-RIGHT" uses H2 tag instead of H1. Page has no H1 element.
- **Expected Behavior:** Page should have exactly one H1 as main heading

- **Browser:** All browsers

### Issue #3: Button Padding Not Responsive
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Component:** CTA Button (`.cta-mega`)
- **Affected Viewports:** Mobile (375px)
- **Description:** Button uses fixed padding `px-16 py-8` (64px horizontal, 32px vertical) that doesn't scale for mobile.
- **Expected Behavior:** Padding should scale responsively (e.g., px-4 py-3 on mobile, px-16 py-8 on desktop)
- **Actual Behavior:** 64px padding on each side leaves only 311px content width on 375px viewport
- **Evidence:** `button-mobile-375.png`

### Issue #4: Button Text Wrapping on Mobile
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Component:** CTA Button text
- **Affected Viewports:** Mobile (375px)
- **Description:** Button text "START PROJECT NOW" wraps onto multiple lines due to fixed padding and large font.
- **Expected Behavior:** Text should remain on single line or adjust font size responsively
- **Actual Behavior:** Text wraps awkwardly, creating unbalanced button appearance
- **Evidence:** `button-scrolled-mobile.png` shows multi-line text
- **Impact:** Reduces button readability, weakens call-to-action effectiveness
- **Browser:** Mobile browsers

- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Component:** Hero heading, Button text
- **Affected Viewports:** Mobile (375px)
- **Description:** Hero heading uses fixed 48px font (12.8% of mobile viewport) and button uses fixed 24px without responsive scaling.
- **Expected Behavior:** Font should scale down proportionally on mobile (e.g., 28px heading on mobile)

### Issue #9: Split Container Layout Break at Tablet
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Component:** `.split-container` (features + tile preview)
- **Affected Viewports:** Tablet (768px)

### Issue #21: No Loading State for Tile Animation
- **Severity:** LOW
